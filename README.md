# About the project


It is a web app built with streamlit to identify the question pairs that have the same interest.
When user enter the questions it will tell that these two questions are identical or not.


The dataset which used here is qoura dataset. Qoura first conduct the competition to identify the questions which have same interest. This can help the companies to merge the identical questions and increase the efficiency and not to give multiple answers of identical questions.
